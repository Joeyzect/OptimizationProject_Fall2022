# Speed Dating Optimization
This repository contains code for a speed date matching algorithm developed for class 6.7201, MIT Fall 2022. 

The algorithm aims to pair users based on "like" scores to maximize global satisfaction, given constraints on religious preferences, two-person relationships, etc. Here, we achieve global match satisfaction 40 points over baseline.
